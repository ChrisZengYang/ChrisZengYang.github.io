        <h1>The History of Minecraft</h1>

        <p>
            Released in 2011 by Mojang Studios, Minecraft was created by <em>Markus "Notch" Persson.</em>
            Development began in May 17, 2009, but was originally made as an experiment to test
            random cave generation.

            Looking at Minecraft's early development, you'd probably be shocked at how simple it was.
            The graphics were simple and way more saturated, and the gameplay was very basic.

                At first, Notch worked on Minecraft by himself.
                Other people started to work on it with Notch after he started a company named "Mojang Specifications", later renamed to simply "Mojang".
