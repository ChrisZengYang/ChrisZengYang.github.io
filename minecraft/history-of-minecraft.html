        <h1>The History of Minecraft</h1>

        <p>
            Released in <strong>2011 by Mojang Studios,</strong> Minecraft was created by <em>Markus "Notch" Persson.</em>
            Development began in <strong>May 17, 2009</strong>, but was originally made as an <strong>experiment</strong> to test
            random cave generation.

            Looking at Minecraft's early development, you'd probably be shocked at how <em>simple</em> it was.
            The graphics were simple and way less detailed, and the gameplay was very basic.

                At first, Notch worked on Minecraft by <em>himself.</em>
                Other people started to work on it with Notch after he started a company named <strong>Mojang Specifications,</strong> later renamed to simply <strong>Mojang</strong>.

            The game was released on <strong>October 7th, 2011</strong>, with a mobile version following shortly after.
            Later, Notch sold Minecraft to <strong>Microsoft</strong> in 2014 for <strong><u>$2.5 Billion USD.</u></strong>
